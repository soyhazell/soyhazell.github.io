            <p>Hi, I'm Hazel! I'm a graphic design student with a passion for visual storytelling and creative problem-solving.</p>
            <p>My graphic design journey began when I sought to blend my love for art with my admiration for technology. As I explored the endless possibilities of design, I became fascinated with its ability to convey messages and evoke emotions through visual elements.</p>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I've delved into various aspects of graphic design, from typography and layout to digital illustration and branding. I believe that effective design should not only be visually appealing but also convey a meaningful message and engage the audience.</p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in design projects, you can find me seeking inspiration in art galleries, experimenting with different mediums, or capturing moments with my camera. I'm also passionate about using design as a tool for social change and advocate for inclusivity and diversity in the creative industry.</p>
